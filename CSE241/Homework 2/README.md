##### 1) 	
    User moves must be "A1" or "A 2" format. 
    Letters and numbers may change depends on board size.
      
##### 2) 
    'x' makes the first move,
    'o' makes the second move.   
    Computer always makes the first move.
   
##### 3) 
    In the file names, ".txt" must be there.
    The file names cannot be ".txt" or "..txt".
   
##### The file design is as below:

    (board size)
    (game mode)
    (the player who should make the move)
    (current board/the board array)

##### Game mode is 1 or 2.
    - 1 is user vs user game.
    - 2 is computer vs user game.
